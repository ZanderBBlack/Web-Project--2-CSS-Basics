                <h2>What was the context of the Treaty? Why did it take place?</h2>
                <p>The federal government wanted access to the Objiwe lands in present day northwestern Ontario and
                    eastern
                    Manitoba. In 1869 the government began making a road and waterway system with the primary objective
                    to
                    provide access to the Canadian Interior. The Ojibwe would "cede, release, surrender and yield" all
                    rights to
                    their land to the Governement of Canada in echange for various good and Indigenous rights to hunting
                    and fishing.
                    This land included an area measuring 14,245,000 hectares (ha) which the governemnt had intentions of
                    turning into farming land
                    in the future.

                <h2>How did this Treaty come to be?</h2>
                <p>The federal government appointed Robert Pither, a former Hudson's Bay employee, to be sent to the
                    Objiwe as an Indian agent
                    (a government representitve on Indigenous reserves) in 1870. He was then sent to Fort Frances
                    of northwestern Ontario, where he was to “establish and keep upfriendly relations” with the
                    Indigenous peoples.
                    The Ojibwe were ready to negotiate a treaty, they made it clear to Wemyss Simpson (an appointed
                    Indian commissioner with the authority to make treaties)
                    that they had no intention of permitting “farmers to settle” on their land. Indicating that they did
                    not intend to cede their rights to the land and wanted
                    compensation exchange for allowing the development of specific government projects on their
                    territory. They later came to a negotiation however many promises werent
                    kept.

                    and to provide them with various financial gains,
