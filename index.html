        <section>
            <h2>What was the context of the Treaty? Why did it take place?</h2>
            <p>The federal government wanted access to the Objiwe lands in present day northwestern Ontario and eastern
                Manitoba. In 1869 the government began making a road and waterway system with the primary objective to
                provide
                access to the Canadian Interior. The Ojibwe would "cede, release, surrender and yield" all rights to
                their
                land to
                the Governement of Canada in echange for various good and Indigenous rights to hunting and fishing. </p>
