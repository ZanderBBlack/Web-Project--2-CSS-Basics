            <h2>When and where did this Treaty take place?</h2>

            <h2>What was the context of the Treaty? Why did it take place?</h2>
            <p>The federal government wanted access to the Objiwe lands in present day northwestern Ontario and
                eastern
                Manitoba. In 1869 the government began making a road and waterway system with the primary objective
                to
                provide access to the Canadian Interior. The Ojibwe would "cede, release, surrender and yield" all
                rights to
                their land to the Governement of Canada in echange for various good and Indigenous rights to hunting
                and fishing.
                This land included an area measuring 14,245,000 hectares (ha) which the governemnt had intentions of
                turning into farming land
                in the future. </p>

        <!-- Section: How information  -->
        <section>
            <h2>How did this Treaty come to be?</h2>
            <p>The federal government appointed Robert Pither, a former Hudson's Bay employee, to be sent to the
                Objiwe as an Indian agent
                (a government representitve on Indigenous reserves) in 1870. He was then sent to Fort Frances
                of northwestern Ontario, where he was to “establish and keep upfriendly relations” with the
                Indigenous peoples.
                The Ojibwe were ready to negotiate a treaty, they made it clear to Wemyss Simpson (an appointed
                Indian commissioner with the authority to make treaties)
                that they had no intention of permitting “farmers to settle” on their land. Indicating that they did
                not intend to cede their rights to the land and wanted
                compensation exchange for allowing the development of specific government projects on their
                territory. They later came to a negotiation however many promises werent
                kept.</p>

        <!-- Section: Terms of the Treaty information -->
        <section>
            <h2>Terms of the Treaty:</h2>
            <p>Under the terms of the treaty, the Government of Canada promised to set aside reserves for the Ojibwe
                and to provide them with various financial gains,
                including a one-time cash payment of <sup>$</sup>12 per family of five and a yearly payment of
                <sup>$</sup>5 per person.
                These key Crown obligations which were of higher allowance apposed to
                previous treaties at that time.

        <!-- Section: After information -->
        <section>
            <h2>What came after?</h2>
            <p> Treaty 3 became the standard by which the rest of the Numbered Treaties were modeled government also
                raised the annual payments given to the Indigenous peoples of Treaties
                1 and 2 so as to better reflect those of Treaty 3. Later Treaty 3 gained its own police force "the
                Treaty Three Police Service (TTPS)".
                Funded by the federal and provincial government. </p>
